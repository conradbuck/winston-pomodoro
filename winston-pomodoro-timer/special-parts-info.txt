Battery considerations:
stops charging when full 			yes charges to 4.2V
charges when device is off 			yes
charges when device is on 			yes
disconnects system from battery when dead	Yes R10/R11 divider

PCB Feedback from Kevin
-add esd protection chip to board to protect usb data lines when using an onboard programming port (usb-c port), not necessary if using external ftdi chip
-breakout PGOOD and CHG pins to GPIO on arduino so you can have battery indications reflected in LEDs display
-see if you can use deep sleep commands on arduino to minimize battery usage when timer and LEDs not running
-use a mosfet to disable power input to LEDs since they have relatively high leakage current when not in use
-switch to a 3.3v microcontroller so you can also disable boost converter that serves LEDs to save additional power
-follow exact chip layouts provided in datasheets, they are specifically designed to help reduce noise and increase reliability
-put a big ground (with +5V net) under VDD of LEDs for better power distribution and thermal management
